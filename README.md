This project opens up with a Welcome page . Next we have the login/registration page 
which includes 4 options i.e. login,
registration, admin login, and exit options.
While logging in the program check if the entered user id is not banned.
If he’s not banned and the provided user id and password are
correct the person is taken to the main menu. 
If his credentials were wrong option like re-login ,forgot password and register(where 
a new user id can be registered) are provided.
Just after the main – section the main section also contains option for admin login and 
exit.
The admin section contains option for the developer and the teachers to

the FAQ’S in helpdesk . Also, admins can ban or unban a particular User id if some fake 
ids try to log in.
